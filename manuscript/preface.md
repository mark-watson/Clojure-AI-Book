# Preface


The latest edition of this book is always available for purchase at [https://leanpub.com/clojueai](https://leanpub.com/clojureai).  You can also download a free copy from [my website](https://markwatson.com/books). You are very welcome both to taking a free copy and also sharing! I offer the purchase option for readers who wish to directly support my work.

I have been developing commercial Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools and applications since the 1980s and I usually use the Lisp languages Common Lisp, Clojure, Racket Scheme, and Gambit Scheme. This book contains code that I wrote for myself and I am wrapping it in a book in the hopes that my code and this book will be useful to you, dear reader.

I wrote this book for both professional programmers and home hobbyists who already know how to program in Clojure and who want to learn practical AI programming and information processing techniques. I have tried to make this an enjoyable book to work through. In the style of a “cook book,” the chapters can be studied in any order. 

This book uses two of the examples in my Java AI book that is also available for purchase at [Leanpub.com](https://leanpub.com/javaai) and as a free download from my personal web site. I replicate these two bits of Java code in the GitHub repository for this book:

The code for the example programs is available on **github**:

Git pull requests with code improvements will be appreciated by me and the readers of this book.

## Clojure, With Some Java

To be clear, I actually like Common Lisp slightly more than Clojure, even though Clojure is a beautifully designed modern language and Common Lisp is ancient and has defects. Then why do I use Clojure? The Java ecosystem if huge and Clojure takes full advantage of Java interoperability.

Using the Java ecosystem is an important aspect of Clojure development and in the few cases where I use Java libraries from my Java AI book, I will take some care in explaining how to effectively converting Clojure *seq* data to Java arrays, handling returned Java data values, etc.

## My Background and My Specific Areas of AI Research

Even though I have worked almost exclusively in the fields of deep learning (at Capital One) and Knowledge Graphs (at Google and Olive AI) in the last nine years, I urge you, dear reader, to look at the field of AI as being far broader than machine learning and deep learning in particular. I will pay particular attention to Knowledge Graphs and underlying semantic web and linked data technology as an effective and modern approach to Knowledge Representation.

## Personal Artificial Intelligence Journey: or, Life as a Lisp Developer

I have been interested in AI since reading Bertram Raphael’s excellent book *Thinking Computer: Mind Inside Matter* in the early 1980s. I have also had the good fortune to work on many interesting AI projects including the development of commercial expert system tools for the Xerox LISP machines and the Apple Macintosh, development of commercial neural network tools, application of natural language and expert systems technology, medical information systems, application of AI technologies to Nintendo and PC video games, and the application of AI technologies to the financial markets. I have also applied statistical natural language processing techniques to analyzing social media data from Twitter and Facebook. I worked at Google on their Knowledge Graph and I managed a deep learning team at Capital One where I was awarded 55 US patents.

I enjoy AI programming, and hopefully this enthusiasm will also infect you, the reader.
